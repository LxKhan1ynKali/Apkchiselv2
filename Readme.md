apkchisel v2 is a Go-based Android application reverse‑engineering and inspection framework designed for authorized security research, malware analysis, red team simulation, and blue team defense validation.
The tool focuses on static and controlled dynamic inspection of Android APK files to help security professionals understand application behavior, identify weaknesses, and improve defensive posture.
⚠️ This project is intended strictly for authorized environments such as labs, CTFs, internal audits, or written client permissions.
